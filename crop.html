It is arguably the most important agricultural crop that grows in the country. Rice is a staple food pan India, and its cultivation is also widespread across the country.

            <div class="main"><h2> Wheat</h2>India, being the second largest producer of wheat in the world, has a high dependency on this rabi crop for its agricultural income. Wheat is a staple food among Indians, especially in the northern regions.

Wheat requires cool temperatures during its growing season in the range of about 14 degc to 18 degc. Rainfall of about 50 cms to 90 cms is most ideal. However, during harvesting season in the spring, wheat requires bright sunshine and slightly warmer temperatures. Uttar Pradesh is the largest wheat growing state in India closely followed by Punjab and Haryana.
