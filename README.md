# International Women's Hackthon'19
# Project Title: Agricultural League- Land Integration System

## Motivation:
From the research conducted in India and other developing countries we could infer that due to increasing population and breakdown of the joint families has resulted into continuous sub-division of agricultural land into smaller plots. Cultivation in smaller plots has become uneconomical. This ever-increasing land distribution problems faced by local farmers and people associated with agricultural sector have motivated us for the creation and maintenance of the project.

## Overview:
+ Presently, major problems faced by Indian agriculture are cropping pattern, average size of land holdings, production techniques and instability in production due to changing weather and transport management system.
+ Our project is aimed at solving issues that concern with the small size of land holdings and improper production techniques. 
+ The above mentioned problem can be inculcated by bringing all small scale farmers, having lands adjacent to each other. Further, all of them will be suggested to come together and join in their land to form a large piece of land in order to cultivate the field on a whole.
+ Addition, to that a study of the soil quality, moisture content and temperature using moisture sensor, temperature sensor will be done along with machine learning algorithm for predicting the right crop and correct amount of water required in different parts of the field.

## Problem statement:
+ Sub-division and fragmentation make the efficient use of land virtually impossible and add to the difficulties of increasing capital equipment on the farm. All these factors account for the low productivity of agricultural sector.
+ Further, due to unavailability of proper knowledge, regarding how to effectively use the available resources (neglection of crop rotation, inadequate use of manures and fertilisers, use of poor quality seeds, inadequate use of efficient farm equipment) further reduces the productivity.

## Target Audience:
+ This system would directly work towards the betterment of the farmers and workers in the agricultural fields and would indirectly help in growth and development of their country as agriculture sector is one of the major contributors towards the GDP.

## Project Objective:
+ We are planning to build a web application that will locate all farmers with small land holdings. They’ll asked to work collectively in their adjacent land holdings.
+ Further, keeping the quality of soil of all land holdings in mind, best suitable crops will be suggested using machine learning algorithm to ensure effective productivity using 4 parameters: soil type, moisture, weather and previous crop grown on the land. 
+ Finally at the time of revenue distribution, the profit will be distributed among the farmers in the ratio of the their land holdings.
+ After harvesting the crop, the farmers will get information regarding nearby available markets for selling their produce, depending upon those selections the transport management system will come into play wherein they’ll be able to avail transport facilities between their farmlands and desired market of their choice.
+ Along with that we will be developing a prototype of automated irrigation system which will determine the amount of irrigtaion needed in the fields with the help of moisture and temperature sensor.

## Technical framework:
+ Arduino
+ Visual studio (HTML, Javascript, CSS)
+ Jupyter notebook (Python)
+ Firebase
+ Thinkspeak software
+ DHT 11(Temperature Sensor)
+ Soil Moisture Sensor( By meausuring resistance) 
+ Servo Motor
+ 1 10k ohm resistor
+ Jumper Wires

## Project working:

+ The web application different tabs that has general information about Indian agriculture (refer above screenshots ). The tab name "Land Integration System" takes in the input of the farmer who has land less then 5 hectare and is willing to collaborate with other neighbouring small farmers. As per the location of the farmer the neighbouring small scale farmers will be displayed. Further, all the farmer will be collaborated to work collectively.

+ Further, best crop prediction for the integrated land is done keeping in mind the land quality of all small lands which are integrated, to ensure effective productivity (4 parameters: soil type, moisture, weather and previous crop grown on the land).

+ Along with that the hardware part of the project will be determine the amount of irrigtaion needed in the fields with the help of moisture and temperature sensor.

## Future Work:

+ This model will be developed on a small scale i.e for farms present in one village further this model could be extended to nation-wide level incorporating all farms in every state across the whole country.
